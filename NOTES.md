# NOTES

Running log of decisions and findings. The README is written from this file at the end.

## 2026-09-28 — Phase 0: setup

### Environment
- Python 3.12 via uv (`.python-version`, `uv.lock`); `requirements.txt` is exported from the lock.
  System Python on the dev machine is 3.9, which tabpfn-client does not support (needs >=3.10).
- tabpfn-client pinned to 0.6.1. It caps pandas at <=2.3.3.
- macOS: the xgboost wheel needs the OpenMP runtime (`brew install libomp`).
- Scripts run as modules from the repo root (`python -m src.data`, `python -m experiments.00_check_api`)
  so `src` is importable without installing the project.

### TabPFN API (from docs.priorlabs.ai and the tabpfn-client README/source, read 2026-09-28)
- We pin `model_path="v3.5_default"` instead of the default `"auto"`, so a server-side model change
  before the deadline cannot silently change results. Through the API this is **TabPFN-3.5-Plus**
  (base TabPFN-3.5 plus proprietary text processing). All our features are numeric, so the text
  processing should not matter, but results must be labelled TabPFN-3.5-Plus (API).
- Each estimator exposes `last_meta` with the server-reported model version; record it with every
  cached result.
- `random_state` defaults to 0 in the client; we pass it explicitly.
- Regression `predict(..., output_type="full")` returns `logits` (n, n_buckets) and bucket `borders`
  as NumPy arrays. That is enough to compute any quantile, P(Tc > 77 K) and CRPS client-side,
  so no local `tabpfn` package, torch or model weights are needed. "full" has a stricter cap on
  test rows per call than plain predictions; chunk large test sets.
- Metering: predictions cost tokens; uploads and standard fits are free; minimum 10k tokens per
  billable request. Default budget 5M tokens/day and 20M/month (monthly resets on the 1st, UTC).
  The account's daily cap was raised to 15M on 2026-09-28. `estimate_cost()` is free (sends only
  dimensions). Rate limits: 60 predict and 60 fit requests per minute.
- tabpfn-client (via tabpfn-common-utils) sends PostHog usage telemetry by default outside CI;
  opt out with `TABPFN_DISABLE_TELEMETRY=1` (see `.env.example`).
- The token is read from `TABPFN_TOKEN` at call time; we load a git-ignored `.env` with
  python-dotenv. Live calls are opt-in (`TABPFN_LIVE=1` or `--live`).

### Data
- UCI dataset id 464, "Superconductivty Data", license CC BY 4.0. Downloaded as a zip; the two
  CSVs are verified against SHA-256 hashes pinned in `src/data.py`.
- `train.csv`: 21,263 x 82 (81 engineered features + `critical_temp`).
  `unique_m.csv`: 21,263 x 88 (86 element columns H..Rn + `critical_temp` + `material`).
  No missing values in either file.
- Row alignment verified: `critical_temp` is identical row by row, and `number_of_elements` in
  `train.csv` equals the number of nonzero element columns in `unique_m.csv` for all 21,263 rows.
  (Covered by `tests/test_data.py`.)

### Open questions for later phases
- Caching full predictive distributions: 25 repeats x ~7k test rows x n_buckets floats may be too
  large to commit. Plan: cache a fixed quantile grid, P(Tc > 77 K) and CRPS per row; keep full
  logits only for demo rows. Decide once the live check reports n_buckets.
